Welcome to Solitaire!

This is a single-player card game.

The goal of this game is to organize all the card intothe top four stacks.
The four stacks are all divided by suit.

The game starts with stacks that have some cards face up.
To organize these piles you have to move the face up cards around to other piles. 
In doing so you reveal the cards that are hidden.
Once you find a Ace you can move it to one of the four piles and start collecting the same-suit cards.

The order reciprocates from black to red and the order of card value decreases from front to back.

Once you run out of moves, 
you can click on the pickup pile and flip a new card over.
 
Once that pile runs dry you can click the waste pile and you will go through the pile again.
